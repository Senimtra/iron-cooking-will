    "6 chicken drumsticks and 6 chicken thighs",

    "Vegetable oil",
    "1 yellow onion, sliced",
    "2 garlic cloves, minced",
    "1-inch piece fresh ginger, peeled and minced",
    "3 Tbsp curry powder",
    "1 tsp ground cumin",
    "1/2 tsp cayenne pepper",
    "1 (14.5oz) can chopped tomatoes, drained",
    "1 (15oz) can light coconut milk",
    "1 cup frozen peas, thawed",
    "1 cup chopped fresh cilantro leaves"
  ],
  "instructions": "1. Rinse the chicken and pat dry with paper towels. Sprinkle with salt. Coat bottom of a 5-7 quart stew pot or dutch oven with a small amount of oil and set over medium high heat. Add chicken skin side down without crowding, in batches if necessary, and cook until skin is golden brown, about 5 minutes. Turn the pieces over and cook until they are brown on the other side, about 5 minutes more. Transfer to a plate.\r\n2. When the chicken is all browned, add the onion to the pot and cook, stirring for 2 minutes, then add the garlic and ginger to the pot and cook, stirring, until the they are soft about 1 more minute. Add the curry powder, cumin, cayenne, and 1/2 tsp salt and cook for 30 seconds until the spices are fragrant then add the tomatoes and 1 cup of coconut milk. Stir well and let them come to a boil.\r\n3. Return the chicken and any juices to the pot. Surround the chicken with the sauce so that the topmost skin is exposed. If there is not enough liquid to bring the sauce almost up to the top of the chicken, add as much of the remaining coconut milk as needed. Reduce heat to simmer and cook uncovered about 45 minutes. Stir in the peas and cilantro, cover, and cook until the peas are hot, about 5 minutes more. Test the chicken by cutting to the bone, if needed continue to cook, covered, until chicken is done. (To save our kids from having to cut the chicken from the bone, we took the chicken out, cut it into bite size pieces, then returned it to the pot for about 5 minutes of additional cooking.)\r\n4. Serve hot over rice and with a vegetable side.",

Prepare this salad at least 4 hours prior to serving to let everything - except the avocado - marry joyfully in the bowl.\r\n3. You do want to let the avocado bathe in the lime juice of the dressing - better presentation that way, and you can store the avocado pieces in a small container. Then, pour the dressing off the avocado and mix the salad with the dressing, then dress the top of the salad with the avocado pieces at service. Very pretty dish & the absence of any oil seems to make all the veggies sparkle in a light citrus glow. You want this salad well chilled, but if you don't bathe the avocados in the dressing first, they will end up looking like grey lumps of pork as the air hits them.",

    "1 boneless pork shoulder roast, about 3 pounds",
    "4 large shallots or 2 small onions",

    "2 Tbsp chopped fresh ginger1 Tbsp chopped fresh turmeric or 1/2 tsp ground turmeric",

    "1 tsp fresh ground black pepper",
    "2 Tbsp fresh lime juice",
    "1 Tbsp firmly packed light brown sugar",
    "2 tsp salt",
    "3 Tbsp vegetable oil"
  ],
  "instructions": "1. Combine the shallots, chiles, garlic, ginger, turmeric, galangal, lemongrass, coriander, pepper, lime juice, sugar, salt, and 1 Tbsp vegetable oil in a mortar and pound to a smooth paste with the pestle, or puree in a blender or food processor to a smooth paste.\r\n2. Heat 2 Tbsp of oil in a wok or skillet over medium heat. Add the spice paste and saute until fragrant, about 5 minutes. Stir frequently to avoid splattering, and run your fan on high. Remove from pan and let cool. The paste can be made up to a day in advance and refrigerated in an airtight container.\r\n3. Trim the roast of excess fat, if any. Using a sharp knife, make a deep slice in the center of roast, starting and ending 3/4 inch from the ends, and cutting almost though to the other side of the roast. You should have a nice pocket about 6 inches long.\r\n4. Fill the pocket with spice paste and tie the roast back together with kitchen twine or pin it with metal skewers. Spread the remaining paste all over the outside of the roast. If any spice mixture remains, set it aside to add during the grilling process.\r\n5. If you have a rotisserie, this is probably the best way to cook the roast. Preheat your grill to high and cook for about 1.5 hours.\r\n6. I used the indirect cooking method. Move the charcoals to either side of the place where you plan to cook the roast, and place a drip pan in the middle. If you have a gas grill where the coals are not movable, either turn off the middle burner or just put a drip pan made of aluminum foil directly over the center burner. To make a foil drip pan, just tear 3 pieces of foil about 16 inches long, overlap them so they are the width you want, then fold the edges up about 2 inches to form a make-shift drip pan.\r\n7. After setting up the grill, preheat it on high. Turn the grill down and place the roast over the drip pan. Adjust heat or coals so the internal temperature rests at about 350 F. This will ensure nice browning without burning, and should result in a cook time of about 2 hours. Turn the meat occasionally during cooking so all sides get equally browned, and rub on additional spice mixture if any.\r\n8. Transfer roast to cutting board or platter and let stand for 10 minutes before removing strings and cutting into thin slices to serve.",

Reheat the oil used to cook the Eggplant and add one more Tbsp. Add the minced onion and saute 2 minutes then add the garlic (feel free to add more garlic if you like garlicky rice) and saute until the garlic is golden brown but not burned (about 1 minute). Add all of the rice to the skillet and saute, turning over occasionally, about 2-3 minutes.\r\n6. Put rice in a serving dish and serve with the Shrimp Creole and Tabasco sauce for adding at the table.
